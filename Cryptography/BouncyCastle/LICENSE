BitPool uses a very small subset of the full BouncyCastle C# API. Not all features were required, so many were stripped out for compactness.

This subset is based on the file "bccrypto-net-1.7-src-ext.zip" obtained from http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/index.html .
This source includes the previously-patent-protected (no longer, as of 2012) IDEA cipher.
